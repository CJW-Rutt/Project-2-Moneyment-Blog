In our survey, we had 11 participants, in different age groups and employment levels talk about their financial tracking methods. Through this survey, we able to learn three major themes. 

First, participants had a strong preference for financial apps that deliver visually engaging content and an interactive user experience. 

Secondly, safety was another concern among the surveyed. They emphasized the importance of protecting their information and displayed a clear preference for apps associated with established financial institutions, and security measures.

Finally, our survey saw a need for assistance with financial literacy and financial jargon. Participants expressed a desire for simplified language and educational resources within a financial app. 

These insights provide valuable guidance for our Moneyment designers and developers looking to create user-friendly and trustworthy app that will make an impact on our community.
