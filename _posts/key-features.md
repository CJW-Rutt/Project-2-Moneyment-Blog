Moneyment will have many key user-friendly features designed to help you track and manage your finances.  The main feature of Moneyment is our animated tree which represents your balance. Watch as the tree's fruit grows with each financial goal you achieve and every successful budget you maintain. It's a visual and rewarding way to track your financial progress.

With our Save First, Spend After feature, you will become a pro at income tracking. You can seamlessly link your accounts and  budgeting goals that align with your financial objectives. This feature empowers you to take control of your spending. 

Our dedicated goals and budgeting section offers AI help with setting and managing your budgets. Moneyment provides you with the tools and guidance you need to succeed.

Moneyment also offers milestone tracking, allowing you to visualize your financial growth. As you hit more milestones, watch your forest flourish. You can share your achievements on social media without revealing your financial goals or status, inspiring others to take charge of their finances too.

Moneyment will be there in a fun and engaging way to help you manage your finances.
