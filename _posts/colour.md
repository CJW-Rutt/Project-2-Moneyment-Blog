Our initial color scheme featuring orange, white, and black might have had its aesthetic appeal, but when it comes to accessibility, it was not the right choice for our app. As we need to make our app accessible to all users, we made the decision to explore a broader range of colors.

With this, our design team lead by Giovana, made  a selection of color palettes. These new palettes maintain some our original colors but are more accessible. The aim is to strike the right balance between aesthetics and usability. 

The team has decided to move forward with colour option #3 for now as it has a great range of shades and fits with our addition of nature elements in our app.
