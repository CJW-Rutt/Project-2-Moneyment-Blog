In September 2023, Giovana, Kaitlyn, Sara, and Hayden pitched Moneyment to the D3 cohorts, earning a spot among the nine selected apps for development. With the addition of Corey, Joey, Justin, Jacob, and Jenny, our team set out to create a groundbreaking AI-powered money management app.

Our mission to complete by December 8th is to use AI to help financially empowerment and providing personalized recommendations and strategies. The journey from idea to complete will need collaboration, creativity, and hard work.  Stay tuned for updates as we shape this app together!
