Our updated logo perfectly emphasizes our brand as we move into the development phase. The core design remains, with the 'M' still taking center stage. However, we've introduced our new color scheme, adding teal shades and moving away from our original orange color. This logo represents the steps and progression towards financial success to achieve financial success.
