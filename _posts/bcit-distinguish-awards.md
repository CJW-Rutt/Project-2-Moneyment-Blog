This week, Giovana took the lead on behalf of our team and had the incredible opportunity to showcase Moneyment at the prestigious BCIT Distinguished Awards Gala. During the gala she presented our Figma based mock-up for Moneyment and got valuble feedback for our app. It was an exciting oppurtunity. 

Below you can see the updated mock-up and some changes in the key features. We have moved away from the tree design to help create a more user friendly app, that can help students be in control of their finances.
