Lights, camera, action! Our recent filming day took us had us capturing our main character as she spent a day navigating financial decisions to save for her mom's birthday present, showcasing the practicality and real life situations impact of the app.

The filming process was a whirlwind and a huge collaboration. From finding locations around BCIT and Burnaby, to props, cameras and challenges our team worked tirelessly to bring the story to life.

It was a ton of fun and now it's time to get on to editing!
